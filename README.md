# SuperBowl_Squares

## Overview
Using historical super bowl data, create a 10x10 grid of super bowl squares that displays the expected payout for each
square using payouts of 25% per quarter.

Eventually:
1- add all playoff games instead of just super bowls.
2- allow for user input for the payouts
